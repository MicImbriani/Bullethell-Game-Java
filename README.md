# SEPR (Software Engeneering Project).

SEPR is a team-based module at University Of York that attempts to promote independent learning through the development of a VideoGame (Kroy).

The game was developed in Java, relying on many features provided by the external library LibGDX.
Unit testing was also extensively produced and performed on the code.
